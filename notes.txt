- "there are endpoints we need that sit between CI and S3"
- "used to be netlify functions, there as a POC in firebase"
- "Hypha SHOULD BE - a proxy that lets you connect to a remote function"
    - from a browser, I can connect to another browser,
    - allows people to share files and cuntionality
- chatbot is a service registered in Hypha
- Hypha also has a triton runner
- wtf is "backoffice" ? Seems to be a project form Fynn?


idk what this is:

backoffice publish "${{inputs.resource_id}}" "staged/${{inputs.stage_number}}" "${{inputs.reviewer}}"

Deploying stuff?

uploader is gonna be a pure frontend application (check heremy msg on eleemnt)
    - it interacts with S3
    - it also interacts with the review service- register_review_service -> hypha calls it to register it with hypha
    - Hypha has a list of services o start, api.py is somewhere in there
        - updating bioimage-uploader-review...api.py needs hypha to come get it again
    - bioimgae-ploader-review/.../__main__.py start a local hypha server
        - pip install hypha for that

imjoy core and rpc - runs remote services
- list services? list of functions
- function ca;lled "chat"
- frontend - review function  -


- frontend is at netlify
